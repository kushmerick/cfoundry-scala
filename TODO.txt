- write script to bump version and package up as a JAR

- better unit test coverage; finish mock HTTP CRUDer

- implement "update"
  (https://github.com/kushmerick/cfoundry-scala/blob/master/src/org/cloudfoundry/cfoundry/resources/Resource.scala#L495)

- all properties & relationships of all resources -- very incomplete
  today

- support for dependencies that hang off resources: app bits & files,
  and user roles.

- eliminate declarations: if CC sends "foo_guid" then infer parent
  Foo; if CC sends "foos_url" then infer child Foo; otherwise infer
  property "foo".

- reimplement Java friendliness with the Scala macro feature when it
  supports adding new members to a class

- support refresh_token

- Scala consumption of the JF API is weak; for example the following
  does not compile: "for (org <- client.getOrganizations) { ... }".
  The following implicit conversation is inadequate: "implicit def
  resourceList2resourceBuffer[T <: Resource](list: java.util.List[T]):
  scala.collection.Iterable[T] = list"
