- write script to bump version and package up as a JAR

- implement "update" (https://github.com/kushmerick/cfoundry-scala/blob/master/src/org/cloudfoundry/cfoundry/resources/Resource.scala#L495)

- all properties & relationships of all resources; application bits & files will require special code 

- eliminate declarations: if CC sends "foo_guid" then infer parent Foo; if CC sends "foos_url" then infer child Foo; otherwise infer property "foo".

- reimplement Java friendliness with the Scala macro feature when it supports adding new members to a class
